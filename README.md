####Some scripts. That's it.

####Descriptions:
- `pastie`: Posts a file to pastie from the command line.
- `auto_readme.py`: Automatically generates the descriptions in this README.md by parsing scripts for "Description: *" line
- `pbdo`: Runs actions based on your clipboard using pbpaste
- `nvas`: Opens the filenames provided in the args in Neovim (only if it's currently running) detecting $NVIM_LISTENER_ADDR. This is useful for the new :terminal mode, so that you can open a file in the current neovim without leaving terminal mode.
